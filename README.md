# üåü Arabic Sentiment Classification of Tweets

This project focuses on classifying Arabic tweets into **positive** or **negative** sentiments using **natural language processing (NLP)** techniques and **machine learning algorithms**. It addresses the unique challenges posed by the Arabic language, such as complex morphology, diverse dialects, and limited datasets.

---

## üöÄ Project Overview

The project utilizes the **Arabic Sentiment Analysis SS2030 Dataset**, which includes:
- **Total Tweets:** 4,252
- **Positive Tweets:** 2,436
- **Negative Tweets:** 1,816

Each tweet is labeled as **0** (Negative) or **1** (Positive). The dataset is split into **80% training** and **20% testing** while maintaining class balance.

## üîß Key Features

1. **Data Preprocessing:**
   - Extract Arabic words using regular expressions.
   - Remove common stopwords with the NLTK library.
   - Perform stemming using the ISRI Stemmer.

2. **Feature Extraction:**
   - Vectorized text using **TF-IDF**, limited to the top **5,000 features**.

3. **Model Development:**
   - Trained a **Logistic Regression** model with **max_iter=1000** and **random_state=42**.
   - Saved the model and vectorizer using the `pickle` library for future inference.

4. **Evaluation Metrics:**
   - **Accuracy:** Training - 94.2%, Testing - 89.6%.
   - **Precision, Recall, and F1-Score:** Balanced across both classes.

5. **Performance Summary:**
```bash
| Sentiment | Precision | Recall | F1-Score |

| Positive  | 0.91      | 0.88   | 0.89      |

| Negative  | 0.88      | 0.91   | 0.89      |
```
